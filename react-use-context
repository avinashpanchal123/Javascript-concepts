react context =>
Context is the global object that holds the value you want to share across your component tree.
***useContext is a React hook that allows you to access the value of a context directly within a functional component.
Call useContext at the top level of your component to read and subscribe to context.
"subscribe" here refers to the automatic re-rendering of the component in response to changes in the context value,
ensuring the component's UI stays in sync with the latest data.
